# UoB-Drinking-Games
An Android app made with AndroidStudio in Java that contains a number of drinking games for when you forget your playing cards.

Inspired by the likes of Picolo or Jackbox - easy drinking games for when you're at a party or bar and need an icebreaker to get things moving...except these ones
have been taken from the fires of the University of Birmingham's sports night frequenters, meaning they are not for the faint of heart!

The end goal is to have the app work either locally of bluetooth, or online via a server!
